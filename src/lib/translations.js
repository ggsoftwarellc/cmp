/**
 * The default set of translated pieces of text indexed by locale.
 * Values from window.__cmp.config.localization will override these
 * per locale.  Empty values will use the english value provided
 * inline in each component. Because the purpose definitions will change,
 * you will need to update the translations regularly. As a consequence, this
 * translations.js file is very important to keep up to date.
